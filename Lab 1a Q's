1. If the setView isn't set in the locate options then the map defaults to world view. The users location may be found, but the map will not recenter to the users location.
2. a).The geolocation documentation suggests that there is a 95% confidence level in both the location and altitude accuracy.
   b). A heading of 135 would be headed in the SE direction. If you consider N to be at 0, following clockwise to 135 would be between 90, which is E and 180 which is S. The       heading will only be recognized if there is some type of movement and the device is not stationary.
3. I tried Chrome, Firefox and Edge to open my locator map and there were some interesting differences. Edge and Firefox seemed to zoom in much closer than Chrome did, making it somewhat difficult to see where I was in relation to my surrounding area. Edge and Firefox also asked for permissions each time I clicked the 'location' button while Chrome automatically saved the permission.
On my phone, the location was much more accurate (green circle so within 100ft) than the computer. This was expected. However, when opened in Edge on the phone, it had a popup asking to allow once, while using app, or never and then a seperate window to allow location to be found. That's a lot of popups. Also, when opened on the phone, the map was zoomed to far out so it didn't initially show up on the screen. I had to click the + button to get it to come into view.
